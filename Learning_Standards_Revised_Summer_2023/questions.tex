% NOTES

%1) In the line "key=<question key>," do not use any spaces. 

%2) The arguments <learning standards>, <rubric items>, <items mark>, and <question solution> are all optional arguments. However, they must appear in the order listed above (i.e., if you include any rubric items you must have learning standards included or at least include an empty square bracket). The only exception to such is <question solution> which can be included even if none of the other parameters that succeed it are present. Lastly, both <rubric items> and <items mark> must be included simultaneously and be of equal length; the code will not work if this fails.

%3) There are 5 different question types that can be selected for the <question type> argument. We will denote which of these environments are numbered using an asterisk. All environments are numbered strictly within their own environment.
%  - <exercise> This is used to declare an "Exercise"* environment.
%  - <task> This is used to declare a "Task"* environment.
%  - <problem> This is used to declare a "Problem"* environment.
%  - <question> This is used to declare a "Question"* environment.
%%%SBG
%%%Developmental 
%  - <tbd> This is used to declare a "To Be Decided" environment.
% You must select one of these types to save a question.

%4) Grader (GRAD) and Solution (SOL) audiences are already declared within the package documentation. You must however use the following in the document to select the current audience.
%    \DefCurrentAudience{GRAD}
%    \DefCurrentAudience{SOL}
% You may additionally not specify any of these audiences; this would be the student view. Selecting the SOL audience will show <question solution>. The GRAD audience will show <question solution>, and additionally, <rubric items> and <items mark>.

%5) In order to access saved questions, you must include the following line of code.
%    \input{Learning_Standards_Revised_Summer_2023/questions.tex}
% Once this line has been included, you may use \PullQ{<question key>} to insert the question that <question key> is associted with.

%6) Naming question keys should be done using the following procedure
%   key = ch<question chapter/chapter.section number>-<general topic>-<question specific topic>

    \begin{enumerate}
		\item many possible answers. For example take $\begin{bmatrix}
			4\\0\\0\\0
		\end{bmatrix}$
		\item Given that $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ should be unit vectors, $\vec v\cdot \vec w=1\time 1\times \cos \theta =\frac{\sqrt 3}{2}$. Any two vectors that satisfy this equation work. Say $\vec v=\begin{bmatrix}
			1\\0\\0
		\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\\ \frac{1}{2} \\0
	\end{bmatrix}$
		\item there are infinitely many examples, take $\begin{bmatrix}
			1\\1
		\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}
		-1\\1

		\item It is not possible. 
		\item $\vec x=t \begin{bmatrix}
			2\\3\\4
		\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}
		1\\2\\3
	\end{bmatrix}$ where $t\in \bbR$. 
		\item Since the plane passes through the origin, it contains the vectors $\begin{bmatrix}
			1\\3\\4
		\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}
		1\\1\\1
	\end{bmatrix}$. The normal vector of this plane should be perpendicular to both these vectors, That is, if $\vec n=\begin{bmatrix}
	n_1\\n_2\\n_3
\end{bmatrix}$ is the normal vector, we have

\begin{eqnarray*}
	n_1+3n_2+4n_3&=&0\\
		n_1+n_2+n_3&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}
Solving this system, we get infinity many solutions. The general solution is 
\[
\{t\begin{bmatrix}
	1\\-3\\2
\end{bmatrix}\:|\: t\in \bbR\}
\]
Any nonzero vector in this set can serve as the normal vector of the plane we have in mind. Pick $\vec n=\begin{bmatrix}
	1\\-3\\2
\end{bmatrix}$
Then the equation of our plane is $x-3y+2z=0$.

		prompt={In this course, we will frequently use the terms \textbf{definition}, \textbf{theorem}, \textbf{justification}, \textbf{counterexample} and occasionally the term \textbf{proof}. A \textbf{definition} is a statement that assigns meaning to a particular word for the first time. A \textbf{theorem} is a mathematical statement that is proved to hold true. A \textbf{justification} is a series of logical statements that are either based on definitions of previously proven theorems or axioms and that justify the truth value of a statement. Sometimes a justification entails a description of an example or a scenario that shows a statement is false. We call such an example a \textbf{counterexample}. A \textbf{proof} is a precisely written justification using accurate mathematical language.\\This problem demonstrates the meaning of these terms. \\ \\
	The \emph{Law of Parental Support} says: If you get a ``B'' or better in MAT188, your parents will buy you a new car.  Let us accept this as a (true) axiom! Take the following definitions of the underlined terms
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  A student is called	an \underline{A student}  if they never get a grade lower than ``A-'' in a given semester.
		\item  A student is called	a \underline{B student} if they get at most one grade lower than a ``B'' in a given	semester.
	\item  A student is called a \underline{C student} if they get no grade higher than ``C'' in a given semester.
	\end{itemize}
	\medskip
	\noindent
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	Discuss with your group whether the following statements hold or not. For each statement write a justification, in full sentences, that uses the definitions above and the law of parental support. \\
		a) If I am an ``A'' student, I will get a new car from my
		parents at the end of the semester.\\
		b) If I am a ``B'' student, I will get a new car from my
		parents at the end of the semester. \\
		c) If I am a ``C'' student, I will not get a new car from my
		parents at the end of the semester.
        \item Did you use any counterexample in the justifications you gave above?
	\item Consider set $L=\{\text{ Marina, Selin,  Saba, Noor, Sazia, Subat, Camelia}\}$. Every student in the set $L$ takes at least two courses every semester. Suppose Marina, Selin and Saba never get a grade lower that $A-$, Noor, Sazia, and Subat get at most one grade lower than $B$ and Camelia has no grade higher than $C$ in a given semester. List the elements of the following sets. Use proper set notation.

		\item $M=\{x\in L\:|\: x \text{ is a B student}\}$
		\item $S=\{x\in M\:|\: x \text{ is an A student}\}$

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    a) True. If I am an $A$ student, then by definition of an A student, I will not get any grade lower than A- in any class. In particular, my 188 grade is A- or better, which is at least B. So by the law of parental support, they will buy me a car.
    b) False. As a \textbf{counterexample}, perhaps I get an F in MAT188 and an A in everything else. By definition of B student, I am a B student, since only one grade is below B. So, there is no obligation for my parents to buy me a car, as I did not get at least B in MAT188. 
    c). False. The axiom of parental support only says what my parents will do if I get a B or higher in MAT188. It tells us nothing about what happens if I get any other grade.

][ch0-VG-line] %this is written as a comma seperated list with no spaces between commas
    [Correct that they are not colinear*Drawing included, with labelling*]    %this is written as a comma seperated list with no spaces between commas
    If we find the equation for the line passing through any of the two points, we can then check to see if the third point lies on that line. Choosing points $J$ and $K$, to find the direction vector we get:
    $$\vec d = [2-(-1), 6-3, 2-0] = [3,3,2]$$
    Now the vector equation of the line is:
    $$l = [2,6,2] +t[3,3,2]  | t \in \bbR$$
    To test if $L$ lies on this line we set the equation equal to L:
    $$[8,1,-2] = [2,6,2] +t[3,3,2] \\ 2 + 3t = 8 \to t = 2 \\ 6 + 3t = 1 \to t = \frac{-5}{3} \\ 2+2t = -2 \to t = -2$$
    Since the t values do not line up, we know $L$ does not lie on this line and therefore the points are not colinear.

    $l_1$ has a direction vector of $[-2,1]$ which we can see from the parametric form.
    To find the direction vector of $l_2$, rearrange the equation and plug in values for $x$ to find 2 separate points on the line.
    $$2x+4y=7$$ $$y = \frac{7-2x}{4}$$
    choose $x = 0$ and $x=2$ to get the points $(0,\frac{7}{4})$ and $(2,\frac{3}{4})$. Use these points to get the direction vector $\vec d = [0-2,\frac{7}{4} - \frac{3}{4}] = [-2,1]$
    Since they have the same direction vector $[-2,1]$ this means that the two lines are parallel.

    %%     MAKE BETTER       %%
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Each equation represents a plane so the vectors satisfying all three equations is the set of (vectors) points on all three planes, or the intersection of the three planes. 
        \item One way to get a solution space which is a plane, is to make sure all the planes are the same. We can do this by making the equations be multiples of each other. For an explicit example:    
        $$\begin{aligned}  x +  y +  z &= 2\\
	 	2x + 2y + 2 z &= 4 \\
	 	3 x + 3 y + 3 z &= 6 \end{aligned}$$ 
        \item To make the solution space a line, we can take 2 equations which are not parallel/the same planes and which intersect in a line. Then adding a third equation which is some combination of the first 2 equations ensures the solution is a line. For example: 
	   $$\begin{aligned} 2x - y + z &= 0\\
	   x + 3y + 4 z &= 0 \\
	   3x + 2y + 5z &= 0
	   \end{aligned}$$
        \item The easiest way to get a point is to take, for example, $x + 0y + 0z = 0, 0x + y + 0z = 0 $ and $0x + 0 y + z = 0$. On the other hand, most choices of the constants will get a point as the solution space, since typically we expect three planes to intersect in a point. 
        \item One way to make the system inconsistent is to make two of the planes parallel but not coincident: For example
	 $$\begin{aligned}  x +  y +  z &= 2\\
	 x - y +  3 z &= 6 \\ 2x - y + z &= 0 \end{aligned}$$ 
	 is inconsistent since the first two planes don't intersect at all. 
        \item The solution space can never be a circle or two lines. It can only be a point, line or plane.

    Part A. \begin{enumerate}
        \item $T( \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}) = \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}, \hskip 1cm
		\, T(  \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix} )  = \begin{bmatrix}2\\0\end{bmatrix} $ \,\,\,\,\,\, and $T( \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}) = \begin{bmatrix}5\\1\end{bmatrix}
		$.
  \item $A \begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix} =   \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\1 &0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}  =  \begin{bmatrix}x + 2y \\ x\end{bmatrix}.$
  \item $T(\begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\end{bmatrix} ) = A \begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\end{bmatrix} $.
  \item $T( \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}) = T( \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix} ) = \begin{bmatrix}3\\1\end{bmatrix} $, which is 
		$ \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix} +  \begin{bmatrix}2\\0\end{bmatrix} $. We can also use the distributive property of matrices multiplication:
		$$
		T( \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix})  = A ( \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}) = 
		A \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + A \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}) = T( \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}) + T( \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}) ).$$
  \item Yes!  Let $\vec v_1 =  \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ y_1 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec v_2 =  \begin{bmatrix}x_2\\ y_2 \end{bmatrix}$. Then  
			$$T(\vec v_1 + \vec v_2) = A  (\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ y_1 \end{bmatrix}+   \begin{bmatrix}x_2\\ y_2 \end{bmatrix}) = 
			A  \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ y_1 \end{bmatrix} +  A \begin{bmatrix}x_2\\ y_2 \end{bmatrix},$$ which is 
			$T(\vec v_1) + T(\vec v_2).$
   \item Yes! let $\vec v = \begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\end{bmatrix}. $ Then 
		$$T(\lambda \vec v) =   T(\lambda   \begin{bmatrix} x\\   y\end{bmatrix}) = T( \begin{bmatrix} \lambda x\\  \lambda y\end{bmatrix})   = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda x + 2(\lambda y)  \\ \lambda x\end{bmatrix},$$
		using the original definition of the mapping $T$.  But then factoring out the $\lambda$, this is equal to  
		$ 
		\begin{bmatrix}\lambda (x + 2y)  \\ \lambda x\end{bmatrix} =   \lambda \begin{bmatrix}  (x + 2y)  \\  x\end{bmatrix}  = \lambda T( \begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\end{bmatrix})$. 
  \item Yes! Just check that $T( \begin{bmatrix}x\\ y \end{bmatrix}) $ is the matrix product  $\begin{bmatrix}a &  b \\ c &  d\\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}.$
    \end{enumerate}

    Part B.
    Yes this map can be described using matrix multiplication. We have $T'( \begin{bmatrix}x\\y \\z \end{bmatrix}) = \begin{bmatrix} 2 &  3 &  - 1 \\ 1 & -1 & -4\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\y \\z \end{bmatrix}$, as you can check. It does respect addition and scalar multiplication, which you can check directly from the formula:
		$$
		\begin{aligned}
		T'( \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\y_1 \\z_1 \end{bmatrix} +  \begin{bmatrix}x_2\\y_2 \\z_2 \end{bmatrix}) =& T'( \begin{bmatrix}x_1 +x_2\\y_1+y_2 \\z_1+z_2 \end{bmatrix} ) 
		= 
		\begin{bmatrix} 2(x_1+x_2) + 3(y_1+y_2) -(z_1+z_2)\\ (x_1+x_2) -(y_1+y_2)-4(z_1+z_2)\end{bmatrix}. \\ = &   
		\begin{bmatrix} 2x_1+ 3y_1 - z_1 \\ x_1 -y_1-z_1\end{bmatrix}. +  \begin{bmatrix} 2x_2 + 3y_2 -z_2\\ x_2 -y_2-4z_2+z_2\end{bmatrix} \\ =&
		T'(\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\y_1 \\z_1 \end{bmatrix}) + T'( \begin{bmatrix}x_2\\y_2 \\z_2 \end{bmatrix}).
		\end{aligned}$$
		Alternatively (and perhaps more straightforwardly), you can also use the distributive property of matrix multiplication to check this.
		Similarly, the map $T'$ respects scalar multiplication.

                -2
            \end{bmatrix}$ is not in the Domain of $T$

        \item A map is linear when it preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication for all vectors in its domain and for all scalars. To check these conditions for $T$, we choose two arbitrary vectors in the domain of $T$, $\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\y_1 \\z_1 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}x_2\\y_2 \\z_2 \end{bmatrix}$. We compute  
		$$
		\begin{aligned}

		T\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\y_1 \\z_1 \end{bmatrix} + T \begin{bmatrix}x_2\\y_2 \\z_2 \end{bmatrix}.
		\end{aligned}$$
Hence, $T$ does respect vector addition. Similarly, the map $T$ respects scalar multiplication. (Student you must show your work!). Therefore, $T$ satisfies the definition of a linear transformation. Yes! $T$ is linear.
        
        \item Yes this map can be described using matrix multiplication. We have $T\left(\begin{bmatrix}x\\y \\z \end{bmatrix}\right) = \begin{bmatrix} 2 &  3 &  - 1 \\ 1 & -1 & -4\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\y \\z \end{bmatrix}$. We can find this matrix directly or by using the Theorem[Linear Transformations and Matrices] from readings which tell us that the columns of the standard matrix of a linear map are the output of standard vectors in our domain $\mathbb R^3$. 
        Alternatively, the Linear Transformation and Matrices Theorem from the readings states that any linear transformation can be represented by a matrix, and any transformation that can be represented by a matrix must be linear. We already showed $T$ is linear, so we can write $T$ using matrix multiplication.

    \begin{enumerate}
            \item Yes since the Rank of $A$ is equal to the number of columns of $A$. That is there is a pivot in every column. Hence $A\vec x=\vec 0$ has a unique solution, or $A\vec x=\vec y$ has at most one solution for any $\vec y$. 
            \item No. Not every row has a pivot. That is there exists a $\vec y$ in the codomain for which $RREF[A|\vec y]$ has a pivot in the augmented column. It is not easy (but possible) to find an example of a vector that can not be mapped. To do so, you can augment $RREF(A)$ with $\vec e_4$. Note that this gives an inconsistent system. Then row reduces back to find a  $\vec y$ in the codomain that makes the system $A\vec x=\vec b$ inconsistent.

    %[<items mark>]      %this is written as a comma seperated list with no spaces between commas
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Yes, $T$ is linear. Its matrix is $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 \\
		1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix},$ which is the matrix of coefficients of linear forms defining the map.
        \item The source and target space are all of $\bbR^3$.
        \item This is really just repeating what we did in problem B. Again: Suppose that $\vec b \in \mathbb R^3$ is in the image of $T$. This means that there is some $\vec x$ in the source $\mathbb R^3$ such that $T(\vec x) = \vec b$.
		For that $\vec x$, we have $\begin{bmatrix}x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\ x_2 \\ x_1 + x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix}  = \vec b$ showing that $\vec x$ is a solution to $A\vec x = \vec b$. Conversely, if
		$A\vec x = \vec b$ is consistent, then there is  vector $\vec x$ which satisfies  $\begin{bmatrix}x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\ x_2 \\ x_1 + x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix} $ showing that 
		$A\vec x = T(\vec x) = \vec b$, so $\vec b$ is in the image of $T$.
        \item The image is
		any vector $T(\vec x)$ in $\bbR^3$; this will be any vector of
		the form  
		$\vec y = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2 + x_3 & x_2 & x_1 +
		x_3\end{bmatrix}^T$.  Thus the image will be any $\vec y$ for
		which we can find an $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ solving this
		equality.  Row reducing the augmented matrix, we have 
		$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & \vrule & y_1\\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \vrule & y_2 \\
		1 & 0 & 1 & \vrule & y_3 \end{bmatrix} \to
		\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & \vrule & y_1 - y_2\\
		0 & 1 & 0 & \vrule & y_2\\
		0 & 0 & 0 & \vrule & -y_1 + y_2 + y_3 \end{bmatrix},$$
		so the image is $\{\vec y\in\bbR^3\ \vrule\ y_3 = y_1 - y_2\}$. Geometrically, this is a plane through the origin in $\mathbb R^3$ with normal vector $[1 \,\,-1\,\,\, -1]^{tr}$.
        \item No!  We just verified that the image of the map $T$ is a plane, which is NOT the whole target $\mathbb R^3$. Any $\vec y$ in the target which does not satisfy
		$y_3\ne y_1-y_2$ will not be hit by $T$, that is, we have no solution to $T(\vec x) = \vec y$.
		So $T$ is not surjective, hence it can't be invertible (since invertible means SURJECTIVE AND INJECTIVE. Alternatively, we can also say that $T$ is not injective: note that 
		$T\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}\right) = T\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\right) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}.$ So there are two different vectors taken to the same vector by $T$, and it is not injective. Hence $T$ is not invertible.           
		So also the matrix of $T$ is not invertible. Its rank can not be three, because if the rank of a $3\times 3$ matrix is 3, then it is invertible.

    Recall that subspaces must contain $\vec{0}.$
		Therefore, every subspace of $\mathbb R$, $\mathbb R^2$ and $\mathbb R^3$ must be a object that pass the origin. They must also be closed under scalar multiplication and vector addition.
		So, we may make the following observations.
		\begin{enumerate}
            \item One of the subspaces of $\bbR$ consists of the zero vector $S = { \vec 0 }$ since it must contain the zero vector, and adding no more vectors means it will satisfy properties (b) and (c) as well.  If we add a single other number, like 1, to the subspace, scalar multiplication would then cause every real number to be in the space, so $\bbR$ is the only other subspace of $\bbR$.

    \begin{enumerate}
            \item A basis is a set of vectors that spans a set and is linearly independent. Since $W$ is defined to be the span of the two vectors in $\mathcal B$, we know that the first property holds. To check that they are linearly independent, we check if one can be written as a linear combination of the other:
            $$\begin{bmatrix}
                1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 2
            \end{bmatrix} = k \begin{bmatrix}
                2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 3
            \end{bmatrix}$$ $$1 = 2k, -1 = 0k, 0 = k, 2 = 3k$$ $$k = \frac{1}{2}, -1 = 0, k = 0, k = \frac{2}{3}$$ Since all 4 equations can not be true (and one of them is nonsense) we say the linear combination is not possible and they two vectors must be linearly independent. This shows that $\mathcal B$ is a basis for $W$.
            \item Since $\begin{bmatrix}
                3 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ 5
            \end{bmatrix}$ is equal to $\begin{bmatrix}
                1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 2
            \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
                2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 3

This means that the dimension of the image $W$ is two (This is an important theorem; see the book Theorem 3.3.6. Know this one!). So any two linearly independent vectors in $W$ will be a basis. The columns of the matrix span $W$ (another important book theorem from the same section), so we can pick any two linearly independent columns. The first two work.
         \item We already decided that any two linearly independent columns of $W$ would work for a basis, so choosing the column \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} should work, making the basis $\frak U = \{ \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \\ 13 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \}$.

    \begin{enumerate} 
        \item Indeed we need three elementary row reductions. There are a few possible sequences, one of which is

$$
A\quad R_1\to -2R_1+R_2 \quad \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & -15 \end{bmatrix} \quad R_3\to R_2+R_3 \quad \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & -12 \end{bmatrix}  \quad -R_2 \quad \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & -12 \end{bmatrix}

Hence
$E_1 = \begin{bmatrix}

        and $E_2= \begin{bmatrix}
            1&0&0\\0&-1&0\\0&1&1

        Note it is possible for students to multiply row 2 but -1 in the first and not the second step, and in that case, $E_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
            1&0&0 \\ 2&1&0 \\ 0&0&1\\
        \end{bmatrix}$
        and $E_2= \begin{bmatrix}
            1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&1&1

    $\det E_3=-1$, $\det E_2=\det E_1=1$, $\det A = 12$ and so $\det A_2 = -12$.

         From a determinant theorem, we know   $\det E_3\det E_2 \cdot \det E_1 \cdot \det A = \det A_2$

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Proof: Suppose $\vec v$ is in the kernel of $T$. Then $T(\vec v) = \vec 0 = 0 \vec v$ so $\vec v$ is an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue $0$. (Indeed, the $0$-eigenvectors are exactly the  (non-zero) elements in the kernel of $T$. Can you prove it?).
        \item Proof: (This basically restates 1, remembering that $T$ is injective if and only if $\ker T$ is zero.) Suppose $T$ is injective, then $\ker T$ is trivial. Hence, there is no nonzero vector $\vec v$ such that $T(\vec v)=0\vec v=\vec 0$. Hence zero is not an eigenvalue of $T$. Conversely, suppose $0$ is not an eigenvalue for $T$. Hence there is no nonzero vector $\vec v$ such that $T(\vec v)=0\vec v=\vec 0$. Hence $\ker T$ is trivial.
        \item Proof: If $T(\vec v) = \lambda \vec v$ for some nonzero $\vec v$ in $V$, then $T^2(\vec v) =  T(T(\vec v))  =  T (\lambda \vec v)  = \lambda  T(\vec v)  = \lambda^2 \vec v$. So $\vec  v$ is an eigenvector for $T$ also (though  the corresponding eigenvalue could be different.)
        \item Disprove! Rotation by $\pi/6$ in $\mathbb R^2$ has no eigenvectors! So it can't have an eigenbasis.
        \item False. Let $T$ be rotation through $\pi/2$. There are no real eigenvalues because no vector is taken to a parallel vector by $T$. However $T^2$ is rotation by $\pi$. This takes $\vec e_1$ to $-\vec e_1$, so $-1$ is a real eigenvalue of $T^2$.
        \item Proof by induction.  We did the case $n = 2$ in (3). Inductive hypothesis: $T^{n-1} (\vec v) = \lambda^{n-1} \vec v$. Apply $T$ to both sides to get  $T^{n} (\vec v) = \lambda^{n-1} T( \vec v) = \lambda^{n} \vec v$.

Does such a polynomial exist for all values of $p,q,r$? \\ Note: When we say $(1,p), (2,q), (3,r)$ we are giving the value $f(1)$ the name $p$ e.t.c., and so $p = f(1), q = f(2)$ and $r = f(3)$.}

    Write $f(t)=a+bt+ct^2$. If $(1,p)$, $(2,q)$, and $(3,r)$ lie on the graph of $f$, then $p,q,r$ satisfy the linear equations
    $$
    \left|\begin{array}{ccccccc}

    a & + & 2b & + & 4c & = & q \\
    a & + & 3b & + & 9c & = & r \\

    $$
    Solving this linear system by row reducing its augmented matrix, we find that 
    $$
    a = 3p-3q+r, \quad b = -\frac{5}{2}p+4q-\frac{3}{2}r, \quad\text{and}\quad c = \frac{1}{2}p-q+\frac{1}{2}r,

    so $f(t)=(3p-3q+r)+(-\frac{5}{2}p+4q-\frac{3}{2}r)t+(\frac{1}{2}p-q+\frac{1}{2}r)t^2$. This solution is valid for all values of $p,q,r$.

 ][ch1-COM-augset] %this is written as a comma seperated list with no spaces between commas
    [Used the augmented matrix correctly*Correct final answer with minimal mistakes*]    %this is written as a comma seperated list with no spaces between commas
     The system of equations corresponding to the ellipse $ax^2+bxy+cy^2=1$ going through the points $(1,2)$, $(2,2)$ and $(3,1)$ is:
\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc@{\;=\;}c}
a & +2b & +4c & 1 \\  4a & +4b & +4c & 1 \\ 9a & +3b & +c & 1
\end{array}\right].\]
Using the first equation to eliminate the $a$ variable in the second and third equations gives:
\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc@{\;=\;}c}
a & +2b & +4c & 1 \\  4a & +4b & +4c & 1 \\ 9a & +3b & +c & 1
\end{array}\right]\to
\left[\begin{array}{ccc@{\;=\;}c}

\left[\begin{array}{ccc@{\;=\;}c}
a & +2b & +4c & 1 \\  & b & +3c & \frac{3}{4} \\  & 15b & +35c & 8
\end{array}\right],\]
after multiplying the second equation by $-1/4$ and the third equation by $-1$. Using the second equation to eliminate the $b$ variable in the third equation gives:
\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc@{\;=\;}c}
a & +2b & +4c & 1 \\  & b & +3c & \frac{3}{4} \\  &  & -10c & -\frac{13}{4}
\end{array}\right].\]
The third equation yields $c = 13/40$. From the second equation we obtain:
\[ b = \frac{3}{4} - 3c = -\frac{9}{40}.\] From the first equation we get:
\[ a = 1 - 2b - 4c = \frac{3}{20}.\]

Thus, the ellipse that goes through the points $(1,2)$, $(2,2)$ and $(3,1)$ is
\[ \frac{3}{20}x^2 - \frac{9}{40}xy + \frac{13}{40}y^2 = 1.\]

    The augmented matrix of this linear system is $\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2k & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 6 & 2 \\ k & 0 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, which can be row-reduced to the matrix
\[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 6-4k & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 2k & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2(k-1)(2k-1) & 1-2k \end{bmatrix}.
\]
From this we see that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] The system has a unique solution if and only if $k\ne 1$ and $k\ne\frac{1}{2}$.
	\item[(b)] The system is inconsistent if and only if $k=1$, since in this case the last column of the  augmented matrix is a pivot column.
	\item[(c)] The system has infinitely many solutions if and only if $k=\frac{1}{2}$, since in this case the last column of the augmented matrix is not a pivot column (so the system is consistent), but the third column is also not a pivot column and therefore corresponds to a free variable.

    \begin{enumerate}
			\item Since $\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ is a solution, the system is consistent.
			\item Since the system is consistent, it suffices to show it contains a free variable, in other words there is a column which does not contain a pivot. But $A$ has fewer equations than unknowns, hence fewers rows than columns, and each row contains at most one pivot, it follows that at least one column does not contain a pivot.
			\item \[ A(\vec{x}_1+\vec{x}_2)=A(\vec{x}_1)+A(\vec{x}_2)=\vec{0}+\vec{0}=\vec{0}, \]
			so $\vec{x}_1+\vec{x}_2$ is also a solution.
			\item \[ A(k\vec{x})=kA(\vec{x})=k\vec{0}=\vec{0}, \]

    A rotation matrix must necessarily be of the form $\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta\end{bmatrix}$, so if the matrix $\begin{bmatrix}-0.8 & -0.6 \\ 0.6 & -0.8\end{bmatrix}$ is a rotation, then it must be the case that the angle $\theta$ of the rotation satisfies $\sin\theta=0.6$ and $\cos\theta=-0.8$. The fact that the cosine is negative and the sine positive means that we're looking for an angle that lies in the second quadrant, now since $\arcsin(0.6)=\arccos(0.8)=0.64351$, and our angle needs to lie in the second quadrant, we can readily conclude that $\theta=\pi-0.64351$.

    We have a reflection that maps $\begin{bmatrix}7 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ to $\begin{bmatrix}-5 \\ 5\end{bmatrix}$, so by adding these two vectors we should obtain a vector that is parallel to the line on which we are reflecting. This vector is $\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 6\end{bmatrix}$, which when normalized results in $\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}$. We can now appeal to the formula for a reflection along a line, which we call $T$, in terms of the orthogonal projection along that line, which we call $P$, applied to each of the unit vectors:

    Geometrically, it looks like a rotation by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ satisfies that its square isn't the identity, but its fourth power is. So we just need to write down the matrix for such a rotation, $A=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\frac{\pi}{2} & -\sin\frac{\pi}{2} \\ \sin\frac{\pi}{2} & \cos\frac{\pi}{2} \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$.

    Geometrically, it looks like applying an orthogonal projection twice is the same as applying it once. If we want all entries nonzero, we better project onto a vector with both entries nonzero, so for example $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ works. It is easy to see, after applying the relevant computations, that

    First, let's compute $A^TA$. Let $A-[\vec v\:\vec w]$ then 
	\[
	A^TA=\begin{bmatrix}
		\vec v\\\vec w
	\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
		\vec v&\vec w
	\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\vec v\cdot \vec v&\vec v\cdot \vec w\\\vec w\cdot \vec v&\vec w\cdot\vec w\end{bmatrix}
	\]
	Hence 
	\[
	\det(A^TA)=\det \begin{bmatrix}\vec v\cdot \vec v&\vec v\cdot \vec w\\\vec w\cdot \vec v&\vec w\cdot\vec w\end{bmatrix}=\|\vec v\|\|\vec w\|-\vec v\cdot \vec w
	\]		
	Let $\theta$ be the angle between $\vec v$ and $\vec w$. Then $1\leq \cos\theta\leq 1$. Note that $\vec v\cdot \vec w=\|\vec v\|\|\vec w\|\cos \theta$, and that norm of vectors are non-negative. Therefore $-\|\vec v\|\|\vec w\|\leq \|\vec v\|\|\vec w\|\cos \theta		\leq \|\vec v\|\|\vec w\|$. This guarantees that $\|\vec v\|\|\vec w\|-\vec v\cdot \vec w\geq 0$.

			is an orthogonal set in $V$ (e.g. $\vec z_{\vec{v}^\perp} = z - \text{proj}_{\vec v}(\vec z)$, so this vector is orthogonal to $\vec v$, and since $\text{proj}_{\vec v}(\vec z)$ is parallel to $\vec v$ which is orthogonal to $\vec u$, and since $\vec z$ is orthogonal to $\vec u$, therefore $\vec{z}_{\vec{v}^\perp} \cdot \vec u = \vec z \cdot \vec u - \text{proj}_{\vec v}(\vec z) \cdot u = 0 - 0 = 0$), and by normalizing we get an orthonormal basis of $V$.

		\item 
		Writing the equations as rows yields the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & -2 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$. Since we are looking for the kernel we write the augmented matrix $\begin{amatrix}{4} 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & -2 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{amatrix}$, which row reduces to $\begin{amatrix}{4} 1 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{amatrix}$. This means
        $$x_1 - 2x_4 = 0 $$ $$x_2 - 2x_4 = 0$$ and $$x_3 = 0$$ Since $x_4$ is our free variable, this gives us $$x_1 = 2x_4$$  $$x_2 = 2x_4$$ and $$x_3=0$$, and choosing a value of $x_4=1$ gives us the vector $\begin{bmatrix}
            2 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ 1
        \end{bmatrix}$ as a vector in $V$ and the only vector in the basis for $V$. \\
        Now that I have a basis for $V$, I must normalize it to get the vector $\vec v = \begin{bmatrix}
            2/3 \\ 2/3 \\ 0 \\ 1/3
        \end{bmatrix}$.
        \item $V^{\perp} =$ the set of all vectors perpendicular to $V$. A basis for $V^{\perp}$ can be found using the coefficients of the normal equations used to define $V$. We get basis $= \{ \begin{bmatrix}
            1 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ 0
        \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
            0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ -2
        \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
            1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ 0
        \end{bmatrix} \}$ and to get an orthonormal basis we need to perform Gram-Schmidt, so $$\vec v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \vec v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}, \vec v_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

The vector $\proj_{W}\vec x$ is called the orthogonal projection of $\vec x$ onto $W$, and we found a formula for it: if $\mathcal{U} = \{\vec {u_1}, ...,\vec {u_m}\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $W$, then $$\proj_W(\vec x) = \sum_{i=1}^m (\vec x \cdot \vec {u_i}) \vec {u_i}.$$\begin{enumerate}

        \item We can take $\begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt 2\\ 0 \\1/\sqrt 2 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1 \\0 \end{bmatrix}$ as the required orthonormal basis $\{\vec u_1, \vec u_2\}$ in the theorem.  Then the projection is 
				$$(\vec w \cdot \vec u_1)\vec u_1 + (\vec w \cdot \vec u_2) \vec u_2 = 2\sqrt 2 \vec u_1 + 2 \vec u_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 2\\ 2 \\2 \end{bmatrix}.
				$$
				Now we can take this projection to be $\vec w_1$, and $\vec w_2$ therefore must be $\vec w -  \vec w_1 =  \begin{bmatrix} -1\\ 0 \\1 \end{bmatrix}, $ which is in $V^{\perp}$.
				So the decomposition of $\vec w$ into its components in $V$ and $V^{\perp}$ is 
				$$
				\begin{bmatrix} 3\\ 2 \\1 \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} 2\\ 2 \\2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} -1\\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
				$$ It is unique.
        \item $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 0  & 1/2  \\ 0 & 1  & 0  \\ 1/2 & 0  & 1/2 \end{bmatrix}$.
        \item The kernel is the solutions of $A\vec x = \vec 0$. Solving, we see the kernel is   the one dimensional space with basis $[1\,\,\,\,0 \,\,\,\,\, -1]^T$. This is the same as $V^{\perp}$! This makes sense, since the line through the origin  perpendicular to the plane consists exactly of the vectors which map to zero under the projection to the plane.
        \item We see $1 + 2  = 3$. This is rank nullity for $\pi_V$, since $V$ is the image of $\pi_V$, $V^{\perp}$ is the kernel of $\pi_V$, and $\mathbb R^3$ is the source of $\mathbb R^3$.
        \item $V$ and $V^{\perp}$ have only the zero vector in common. So a basis for $V$ and a basis for $V^{\perp}$ will combine to get a basis for $ \mathbb R^n$. 
					To see why it is an orthonormal basis: we already know all have unit length. We also know that anything in $V$ has dot product against anything in $V^{\perp}$. And the dot product of two elements both in the orthonormal basis for  $V$ or both in  the orthonormal basis $V^{\perp}$ also produces zero.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item True. A least square solution to $A\vec x=\vec b$ is a consistent system closest to $A\vec x=\vec b$. That is, it is a solution to $A\vec x=proj_{Col(A)} \vec b$.

        This is now solvable so we create an augmented matrix and row reduce to get the vector $\vec x$ 
        $$ \begin{amatrix}{2} 49 & 98 & 147 \\ 98 & 245 & 392 \end{amatrix} \rightarrow \begin{amatrix}{2} 49 & 98 & 147 \\ 0 & 49 & 98 \end{amatrix} \rightarrow \begin{amatrix}{2} 49 & 0 & -49 \\ 0 & 49 & 98 \end{amatrix} \rightarrow \begin{amatrix}{2} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \end{amatrix}$$

    \item $A^TA=I_n$.
    \item $A$ preserves the dot product, meaning that $(A \vec x) \cdot (A \vec y) = \vec x \cdot \vec y$ for all $\vec x$ and $\vec y$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

    \item $A^{-1}=A^T$.

    \item Start by justifying that (1) implies (2). Hint: compute the matrix multiplication using the dot product strategy. 
    \item Next, justify that (2) implies (3). Hint: $\vec v \cdot \vec w = \vec v ^T \vec w$.

    (1) implies (2):
From SBG 1 this is true. \\
(2) implies (3):
$A(\vec v) \cdot A(\vec w) = (A\vec v)^T(A\vec w) = \vec v ^T A^T A \vec w = \vec v ^T I_n \vec w = \vec v ^T \vec w = \vec v \cdot \vec w$ \\
(3) implies (4): $||A \vec x||^2 = (A\vec x) \cdot (A \vec x) = \vec x \cdot \vec x = ||\vec x||^2$ \\
(4) implies (5): By definition, an orthogonal matrix is the matrix representation of a transformation which preserves length, so this holds. \\
(5) implies (1): Since $A$ is an orthogonal matrix, it preserves length by definition. Because of this, the length of $A \vec e_1$ and $A \vec e_2$ are both 1 (unit length). To prove that $A \vec e_1$ and $A \vec e_2$ are orthogonal to each other, consider, since $A$ preserves length, 
$||A \vec e_1 + A\vec e_2||^2 = ||A(\vec e_1 + \vec e_2)||^2 = ||e_1 + e_2||^2 = ||e_1||^2 + 2(e_1 \cdot e_2) + ||e_2||^2$ but since $e_1 \cdot e_2 = 0$ we get $||e_1 + e_2||^2 = ||e_1||^2 + ||e_2||^2 = ||A \vec e_1||^2 + ||A \vec e_2||^2$. If $||A \vec e_1 + A \vec e_2||^2 = ||A \vec e_1||^2 + ||A \vec e_2||^2$ that means the two vectors $A \vec e_1$ and $A \vec e_2$ are orthogonal to each other. Now $A \vec e_1$ and $A \vec e_2$ are orthonormal so the columns of A are orthonormal as needed. \\
(6) if and only if (2): Since $A^TA=I_n$ can be rearranged to say $A^{-1}=A^T$ they are the same statement.
